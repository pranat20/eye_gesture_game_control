first install pycharm in you system
check your python version should not be above 3.10 as the mediapipe will not work
after opening pycharm create a new project
now install packages - opencv-contrib-python
                     - mediapipe
                     - AutoGui
and now paste the given code in python file give it the name main.py
and boom your controller is now working
